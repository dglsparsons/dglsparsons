## Hi, I'm Doug, a full-stack engineer working at Shamaazi. ðŸ‘‹

I'm responsible for a range of charity products that serve over **100,000 people.**
I've been working in technology and programming since 2013. BEng in Computer Science from the University of York, UK.

Outside of tech I'm a cat lover, keen skier and a formula 1 fan.
